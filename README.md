### The Calendar & Lifestyle App for College Students

---

## Overview
College students are largely unorganized, much like ourselves. Students use regular
calendar apps (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc.), but they
still experience the same feeling of disorganization. A lot of deadlines, whether it
be for assignments, internship applications, etc., slip through the cracks because
most calendar apps today just fail to be engaging for students. Introducing **Orbit**,
the calendar app for college students. Orbit is specifically tailored for college
students, with next-gen features focused on classes, internships, and more. Instead
of using 10-20 different tools to manage their classes and work life, students can
now do it all from one place.
